Hello everyone, this is the demostration of my system which called teamanager.which is an Online
teamworking tool for JP students. Teamwork is often the best way to complete larger projects. But working in groups can also bring many problems.

下一个ppt

The first problem is task assignment within the team. A small number of team members often have to complete most of the project, which will lead to low enthusiasm of team members and lower team efficiency. Meanwhile, some others may have to wait for them to complete the task, which further reduces team efficiency

what's more, The unclear feedback mechanism makes it impossible for teachers to grade each member's contribution. The traditional way is to fill in the labor table, but many tasks are done by multiple team members, which further increases the difficulty of filling in the labor table. Therefore, a clearer way is needed to let teachers know each member's contribution

There are already some software to help us in teamwork, such as Microsoft Teams, Jira and GitHub, all of which have their own advantages and problems.

Teams is a good solution of the cooperation. It provides a communication channel to the students and teachers. Jira is a software development tool to solve the agile development. It provide various development tools. You can see Gantt chart, line chart etc and GitHub is an open source platform, you can see your teams code in this platform.

although this platform can be the solution of the jp teamwork. but they also have many weakness. Teams can't provide the function of task assignment. And it can't record the task.Jira does not have the concept of teacher's role. Teachers cannot quantify each person's contribution according to Jira. GitHub requires git knowledge. For non-professional programmers, GitHub is not an easy tool to control. GitHub cannot divide tasks too. And teamanager is prepare for these situations.

During this period of time, I have completed the mid-term task set in specification. Now I will introduce the finish work to date for Teamanager project until the mid-term

At first, I Use the Mockplus (like Axure RP) to build a prototype and the RP designment diagram. And then I use StarUML to draw a UML diagram show the function of different class. According
to the UML, I design the database schema and instance.

the most important thing is the implementation. I implement the function set in the specification, which include three part, the user center, team center and the module center now I will demostrate them.

In the implementation, I also face some problem, firstly, as the project grew, more and more code became redundant, affecting speed. what's more, ins this system also have some bug in the service of user need to be repaired.

for the redundant code, they needs to be reconstructed to adapt. and for the bugs I need a systematic test for my software.

The project holds great prospect. for a leader function, they may have ability to create a team, start a task, etc. for a chat room function. Student need a chat room to communicate. The file to save log is important. and I will build a responsive layout to adapt in different platform, such as in mobile and computer. A pretty about page to advertise, need some slogan as well. finally User should decide their interface theme in teammanager.
